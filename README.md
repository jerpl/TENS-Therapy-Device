# TENS Therapy Device 
Designed and implemented a Full-Stack simulation of the Oasis Pro Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation device for pain relief and recovery. The complete design process was followed including use cases, sequence and UML diagrams, interface design, and backend implementation. The interactive UX was built in QT C++. Functionality includes completing preset treatment sessions and storing user information, preferences and past sessions in a database, with the ability to restart sessions with specific settings. Additionally, the responsive interface gives feedback on intensity and safety considerations, as well as automatically disconnecting when inactive or when the connection to an electrode is interrupted. 

This was a remote team project I completed during my degree. I have included it in my portfolio as I gained tremendous group work skills over the course of the project, including conflict resolution and delegation of responsibility. I was placed in a leadership position when several of the group members were having difficulty working together, and I learned that group cohesion is more important to a successful project than the speed and raw talent of the developers. I know that I can take my delegation and conflict-resolution skills into the workplace with me and be an excellent team member.
